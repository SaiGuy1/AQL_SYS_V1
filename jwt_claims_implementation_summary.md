# JWT Claims Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the infinite recursion issues in Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The solution uses JWT claims (stored in user metadata) instead of direct profile table queries, which eliminates the recursion problem while maintaining robust role-based security.

## Changes Made

### 1. SQL Changes (`profiles_table_setup.sql`)

1. **Updated RLS Policies**:
   - Modified all role-based RLS policies to use JWT claims instead of recursive queries
   - Example: `current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::jsonb->>'role' = 'admin'`

2. **Added Role and Location Sync**:
   - Enhanced `sync_role_to_user_metadata()` function to update both role and location_id in user metadata
   - Added proper handling for NULL location_id values
   - Updated the trigger to respond to changes in both role and location_id

3. **Added Location ID RPC**:
   - Created `get_user_location_id()` RPC function for retrieving location IDs with SECURITY DEFINER
   - This allows direct access to location IDs when JWT claims are not available

4. **One-time Sync**:
   - Added script to synchronize all existing user profiles' roles and location IDs to user metadata
   - This ensures JWT claims will be available for existing users without requiring re-login

### 2. Frontend Changes

1. **Updated NavBar Component**:
   - Modified user data fetching to first check JWT claims in user metadata
   - Added fallback to RPC function and localStorage
   - Added auto-update of user metadata when role is retrieved via RPC

2. **Updated JobsList Component**:
   - Modified `fetchJobsForUser()` to use JWT claims for role-based filtering
   - Added location_id retrieval from user metadata with fallback to RPC
   - Ensured supervisor-specific filtering uses location_id from JWT claims

3. **Updated Login Component** (previously):
   - Enhanced role fetching strategy to use JWT claims and RPC functions
   - Added error handling and fallbacks to prevent login failures

### 3. Documentation

1. **Created User Guide**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `supabase_auth_setup_guide.md`
   - Explained JWT claims approach to RLS policies
   - Provided code examples and troubleshooting advice

2. **Added Security Considerations**:
   - Documented best practices for SECURITY DEFINER functions
   - Added notes on proper handling of JWT claims and sensitivity of data

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Eliminated RLS Recursion**:
   - Prevents infinite recursion errors that were causing login crashes
   - Makes the application more stable and reliable

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Reduces database queries by leveraging JWT claims
   - Avoids unnecessary profile table lookups

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Maintains proper role-based access control
   - Uses Supabase's JWT validation for role verification
   - Adds multiple fallback methods to ensure continuous access

4. **Better User Experience**:
   - Login process is now more reliable
   - Role-based access happens seamlessly
   - Changes to roles and locations are automatically synchronized

## Implementation Details

### JWT Claims Usage

JWT claims are accessed in RLS policies using:
```sql
current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::jsonb->>'role'
```

And in frontend code using:
```typescript
user.user_metadata?.role
```

### RPC Functions

We've maintained RPC functions as fallbacks:
```sql
-- Role retrieval
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_role_rpc(user_id uuid)
RETURNS user_role AS $$
    -- Function body
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Location ID retrieval
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_location_id(user_id uuid)
RETURNS uuid AS $$
    -- Function body
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Metadata Syncing

The system now syncs both role and location_id to user metadata:
```sql
-- Trigger for sync
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_role_to_metadata
    AFTER UPDATE OF role, location_id ON public.profiles
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_role_to_user_metadata();
```

## Testing and Verification

To verify the implementation is working:

1. Check user metadata after login to confirm role is present
2. Verify RLS policies by testing access as different user roles
3. Change a user's role and verify it updates in metadata automatically
4. Test supervisor access to ensure location_id filtering works correctly

This implementation resolves the infinite recursion issue while maintaining all security requirements and improving the overall system architecture.
